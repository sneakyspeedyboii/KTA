# Karting Time Analyser

In progress tauri app, for downloading and analysing karting lap times. When it is eventually finished, it should be able to cache and graph the times, aswell as turn the times into a data model which can be used for predicting future averages.

(i hope at least depends how lazy i am)

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Cloning or forking or your own dev idk
