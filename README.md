# Karting Time Analyser

##Archived - Alpha Timing nuked the api I was using and it can no longer fetch download and update times. Cannot be asked to write code to sort through html, so in the mean time this project wont be updated and wont work.

##Maybe ill fix it at some point

In progress tauri app, for downloading and analysing karting lap times. When it is eventually finished, it should be able to cache and graph the times, aswell as turn the times into a data model which can be used for predicting future averages.

(i hope at least depends how lazy i am)

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Cloning or forking or your own dev idk

npm install

npm run tauri dev

(no clue if this works, should)
