# Karting Time Analyser.

## Archived - Alpha Timing removed the api I was using to download the data and the program can no longer fetch download and update times. Cannot be asked to write code to sort through html, so in the mean time this project wont be updated and wont work.

In progress tauri app, for downloading and analysing karting lap times. When it is eventually finished, it should be able to cache and graph the times, aswell as turn the times into a data model which can be used for predicting future averages.

(i hope at least depends how lazy i am)

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Running the program (Installing dependencies)

npm install

npm run tauri dev

(no clue if this works, should)
